```
node -v
```

2. If you haven't installed Node.js in your machine then go to [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in order to install node.

3. It is required to have NPM with version _6.14.0_ or higher. To see what version of NPM is installed on your machine type the following command in the terminal:

## Installing and Executing locally

> A video tutorial is also available [watch it](https://youtu.be/SmSCux_qx_Q).

1. Fork this repository, by clicking the `Fork` button at the top-right on this page.
[![Learn how to fork GitHub projects](/markdown/fork.png?cache=off)](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

2. Clone the forked repository from your GitHub account.
```
git clone https://github.com/[replace-with-your-github-username]/live-resume.git
```

3. Go to the cloned directory (e.g. `cd live-resume`).

4. Run `npm install`.

5. Inner the folder of the cloned project, start the application:
```
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --configuration=en
```
**Note:** the optional parameters:
* ` --host 0.0.0.0` useful if you want to see how your application runs on a mobile or from some other laptop/computer/network. 
* ` --configuration=en` in this example the application will be displayed in **en-US**, by replacing the `en`with `pt` => `--configuration=pt`, the application language would be **pt-BR**. 

6. After that, the command will start a server instance and listen on port `4200`. Open (http://localhost:4200/) in your browser. The **Live Resume** will be displayed.
