            "description": "For as long as I can remember, I have always enjoyed creating and solving, especially in the context of computer games. Later, my interests grew to include photography and chess. <br></br> In 2022, I challenged myself to create my own photography portfolio website, which led me to enroll in the Hack-Reactor bootcamp. After completing the course, I feel like I have found my calling in the field of Full-Stack Engineering. I enjoy the process of creating and solving the challenges I encounter along the way, and I find the end result very satisfying. Full-Stack Engineering is a discipline that combines art and engineering - that is what I like to do.<br></br> In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to ongoing learning and personal growth, which in my opinion never stops."
