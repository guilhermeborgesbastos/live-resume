I also loved playing video games, and as I got older, I became fascinated with the technology behind them.<br><br>While I am relatively new to the field, I have just completed a rigorous and highly respected boot camp program at <i>Hack Reactor</i>. Through this program, I gained valuable hands-on experience and learned a wide range of skills that I am excited to apply to real-world projects.On this site, you will find examples of my work, including three projects that I am particularly proud of. In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to ongoing learning and personal growth.<br><br>"
