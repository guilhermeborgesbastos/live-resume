                "description": "Statistical parameters such as center points are widely used to represent patterns in machine learning. There are three pop- ular center points: mean, median, and mode. Mean and me- dian are pervasively used as features to represent patterns, but mode is not because of its weakness. One of the major problems in the conventional definition of mode occurs when the distribution is multimodal with tied multiple maximum points. Hence, in this paper we propose a modified version of mode, which utilizes the density within a radius. The effectiveness of proposed mode is demonstrated in the emotion recognition application using the Electroencephalogram (EEG). An Experimental result of amalgamating statistical parameters with a new modified parameter suggests the superiority of the proposed statistical parameter over the traditional measures.<br><br>P.K.Thind, V.Katturu, T.Cha and S.H.Cha, Density Based Mode Within Radius and its application to EEG based Emotion Recognition, The Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society (FLAIRS-34) 2021,<br> <a href=\"//journals.flvc.org/FLAIRS/article/view/128558?web=1&wdLOR=c2B5ADC19-9FC7-1245-9A3A-B08F1DE554ED\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Website</u></a>, published by AAAI Press"

                "description": "Ensemble methods are of great importance in machine learning and data mining because combining multiple classifiers often results in better accuracy and predictions in many classification problems. Recently, ensemble methods with multiple Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been suggested in various fields. Simple majority and conventional Borda voting methods were used in the ensemble CNN model. Here, a new voting method to combine multiple CNNs is proposed. The plant disease dataset containing five plant diseases that infect various plants is used to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model. A total of 20 models to recognize five plant diseases were first built with different architectures. Experimental results of amalgamating CNNs with a new voting method suggest the superiority of the proposed voting method over other conventional methods.<br><br> V.Katturu, P.K.Thind, T.Cha and S.-H.Cha, A New Ensemble Method for Convolutional Neural Networks and its Application to Plant Disease Detection, International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2020, LNCS.<a href=\"//http://www.ibai-publishing.org/html/proceedings_2020/proceedings_mldm_2020.php\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Website</u></a>"
